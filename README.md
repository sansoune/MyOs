# myOS
I'm trying to learn how to create an os form scratch using assembly langue

## building bin file 
- run ```make build``` in the terminal will generate three binary files the bootloader the kernel an the os.
- after that you can run the OS.bin file in any virtual machine like qmue 



 


## to publish your changes to github
 run ````make publish text````=<span style= "color: #98c379">***what ever you want to call your commit with*** </span>
